# Lab 6 - City Explorer API

**Author**: Carly Dekock

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Beginning to build an API server for the City Explorer Application. This will allow a user to search for a location, be presented with a map and some interesting information about the area they've selected. Today most of our info will be hard-coded in to test the intial setup of our application.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.-->
